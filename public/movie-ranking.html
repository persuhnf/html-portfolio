<h1>The Best Movies According to Fernanda</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Kill Bill (Vol. 1 & 2!)</h3>
<p>This is only one movie divided in two installments, so it should only count as one. I'm not accepting anything else, thank you.</p>
<h3>Legally Blonde</h3>
<p>A movie that never fails to uplift me!</p>
<h3>Amelie</h3>
<p>Super cute film. Really artistic, with beautiful visuals and a wonderful soundtrack.</p>
